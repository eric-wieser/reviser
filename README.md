Slices up past exam papers (PDFs) into their questions

This assumes you've downloaded [this](http://to.eng.cam.ac.uk/teaching/past_papers/part1a/2004Q/P1A2004Q004.pdf) PDF file to `P1A2004Q004.pdf`. Any PDF will do though.

You'll need to start chrome with `--allow-file-access-from-files` to test locally
